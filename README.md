# Tic-Tac-Toe

You will write a program to implement an extended version of the famous Tic-tac-toe game. The
program can support two players competing against each other. The program will display the game
board, record moves and detect winners.

The Problem
Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a simple paper and pencil game for two players. A grid (matrix) of nxn cells is first drawn. Each player chooses one of two possible symbols (usually X or O). The two players then take turns in drawing the symbols within the cells of the grid. The player who first succeeds in forming a contiguous horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of symbols wins the game, as shown in the figure below. You will write a program to help players play this game. The program will display the empty grid, organize turns, and detect a win as soon as it occurs. It will also record all moves during the game then permits the players to watch a playback of the game at the end. The program should support any grid size from 3x3 to 10x10, and any length for the contiguous line of symbols required for a win.
